# Pagination
This is a project on pagination carried out as part of the Software Engineering program at ALX.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of the project, we are expected to know:
* How to paginate a dataset with simple page and page_size parameters
* How to paginate a dataset with hypermedia metadata
* How to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner

## Technologies/Requirements
* All files are executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.7)
* All files end with a new line
* The first line of all files starts with exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
* All code uses the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.*)
* The length of files are tested using wc
